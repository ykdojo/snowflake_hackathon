Project Description
Title: Scientific Paper Search Web Application

Objective:
The goal of this project is to create a Streamlit web application that allows users to search for scientific papers and view their summaries. The application will be connected to a public Snowflake data source, specifically the OpenAlex dataset managed by Util on Snowflake Data Marketplace.

Features:
- Users can enter a query to search for scientific papers.
- The application will retrieve relevant papers and their summaries based on the query.
- The results will be displayed in the Streamlit app, including the title, authors, and summary of each paper.

Technologies:
- Streamlit: For building the web application interface.
- Snowflake Data Marketplace: For accessing the OpenAlex dataset.
- Snowflake Connector for Python: For connecting to the Snowflake database and executing SQL queries.

Note: The project is part of the Snowflake Hackathon, and the objective is to create a new Streamlit app connected to a public Snowflake data source.

Other Files in the Project Folder:
- Snowflake_Hackathon_Official_Rules.txt: Contains the official rules, terms, and conditions for the Snowflake Hackathon. It provides information about the contest period, eligibility, how to enter, entry requirements, judging criteria, prizes, and other important details related to the hackathon.
