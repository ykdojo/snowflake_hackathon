OpenAlex
Util
OpenAlex is an index of hundreds of millions of interconnected entities across the global research system created & maintained by the nonprofit OurResearch (https://ourresearch.org/).

Description courtesy of the OpenAlex.org website:
~~~
The OpenAlex dataset describes scholarly entities and how those entities are connected to each other. There are five types of entities:
1. Works are papers, books, datasets, etc; they cite other works
2. Authors are people who create works
3. Venues are journals and repositories that host works
4. Institutions are universities and other orgs that are affiliated with works (via authors)
5. Concepts tag Works with a topic

Together, these make a huge web (or more technically, heterogeneous directed graph) of hundreds of millions of entities and billions of connections between them all.
~~~

Util uses OpenAlex & the Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG) to power our advanced machine learning to evaluate the social and environmental impact companies around the globe.
