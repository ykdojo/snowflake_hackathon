To ensure that it's possible to combine different data sources, we need to identify common keys or attributes that can be used to align and merge the data. Here are some steps to achieve this:

1 Identify Common Keys: Determine which attributes are common across the data sources and can be used as keys for merging. For example, the stock ticker and date could be common keys across stock price history, sentiment data, and website traffic data.

2 Standardize Date Formats: Ensure that date columns in all data sources are in a consistent format. This will allow you to accurately align data based on dates. You can use the Pandas to_datetime function to convert date columns to a standard datetime format.

3 Resample Time-Series Data: If the data sources have different time intervals (e.g., daily vs. 15-minute intervals), consider resampling the data to a common frequency. You can use the Pandas resample function to achieve this.

4 Check Data Completeness: Verify that the data sources have sufficient coverage for the stock tickers and time periods you're interested in analyzing. If there are gaps or missing data, consider how to handle them (e.g., interpolation, filling with default values, or excluding incomplete data).

5 Test Merging: Perform test merges using a subset of the data to ensure that the merging process works as expected. You can use the Pandas merge function to merge DataFrames based on common keys.

By following these steps, you can ensure that the data from different sources can be accurately combined for analysis. Keep in mind that the specific steps and functions used may vary depending on the structure and format of your data sources.
